The **Observer pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are automatically notified and updated. This pattern is fundamental for implementing distributed event-handling systems.

#### Why Use It?

- **Decouples Subjects and Observers**: Promotes loose coupling between interacting objects
    
- **Dynamic Relationships**: Observers can be added/removed at runtime
    
- **Event Handling**: Efficiently broadcasts state changes to multiple objects
    
- **Maintains Consistency**: Ensures all observers have the latest state
    
- **Reusability**: Subjects and observers can be reused independently

### Core Components

1. **Subject**:
    
    - Maintains list of observers
        
    - Provides methods to attach/detach observers
        
    - Notifies observers of state changes
        
2. **Concrete Subject**:
    
    - Stores state of interest
        
    - Sends notifications to observers when state changes
        
3. **Observer**:
    
    - Defines update interface for objects to be notified
        
4. **Concrete Observer**:
    
    - Implements the update operation
        
    - Maintains reference to subject (optional)
        
    - Synchronizes state with subject

### Real-World Analogy: News Agency

1. **Subject**: News Agency (e.g., Reuters)
    
2. **Concrete Subject**: Specific news feed
    
3. **Observer**: News outlets (e.g., CNN, BBC)
    
4. **Concrete Observer**: Individual news channels
    
5. **Process**:
    
    - Agency publishes breaking news
        
    - All subscribed channels receive notification
        
    - Channels update their broadcasts accordingly
