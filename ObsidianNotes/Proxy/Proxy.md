The **Proxy pattern** provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. Common use cases include:

- Lazy initialization (virtual proxy)
    
- Access control (protection proxy)
    
- Local representation of remote objects (remote proxy)
    
- Logging requests (logging proxy)
